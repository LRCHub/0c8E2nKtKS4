Cry the night away
You cry the night away
Boy, I think it's over

You'll never realize I'm gone
And we're finally over
Till your heart feels the cold
And the chill of October

You'll never realize the fear
Now it's finally over
Leave your soul to the dark
And the chill of October

Well it's alright for you
And it's alright for me
We're just people who want to believe
We live in a world of dreams but they can't be forever.
