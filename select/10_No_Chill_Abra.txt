Protect your heart at all costs
No one who walks the earth is gold
And paradise is lost
Nothing is worth the tears
And never let them see you cry
It's all so stupid
You'r gonna lose it
You're gonna blow it
If you dont get in control
But im not tryna win i crave this just let me life
Im not tryna win i crave this just let me life
Im not tryna win i crave this just let me life
Im not tryna win i crave this just let me life
Everyones talking bout their fallback game(game, game)
I got no fucking chil cause love is like a drug to me
I wanna share my heart and they think that i'm crazy
Im crazy

Everyones talking bout their fallback game(game, game)
I got no fucking chil cause love is like a drug to me
I wanna share my heart and they think that i'm crazy

I dont wanna dance w u
Cause they say that your kiss may kill me
Then ill be in too deep off drop myself off at yourself
I knew that you were bad news
Stayed awake till half past 2
Havent slept because i was thinkin about you
T's all so stupid
You'r gonna lose it
You're gonna blow it
If you dont get in control
But im not tryna win i crave this just let me life
Im not tryna win i crave this just let me life
Im not tryna win i crave this just let me life
Im not tryna win i crave this just let me life
Everyones talking bout their fallback game(game, game)
