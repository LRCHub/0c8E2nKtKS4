Everything is psychedelic, everything is a bad trip, a bad trip
I don't really have any feeling about it, I mean I have a feeling and I don't care
A film without narration, a film with dialogue, a film without imagery, a film without sound
A horror poem unfolds and our love absorbs it

I slide off the spectrum, I don't fall anywhere
I'm not counting errors
I feel safe with you trash I feel safe with you trash I feel safe with you trash I feel safe with you trash I feel safe with you trashI feel safe with you trash I feel safe with you trash I feel safe with you trash I feel safe with you trash I feel safe with you trash
